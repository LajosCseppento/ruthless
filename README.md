# Ruthless

Ruthless conventions for Gradle projects to keep them DRY. Inspired by `buildSrc` conventions
generated by Gradle `init`. Selfishly tailored for my taste, sorry.

## Features

 - 6 plugins, choose the best fit:
   - `dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless` - multi-use plugin, can apply to init, settings or project
   - `dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.java-application` - Java application
   - `dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.java-gradle-plugin` - Java Gradle Plugin
   - `dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.java-library` - Java library
   - `dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.spring-boot-application` - Spring Boot application
   - `dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.spring-boot-library` - Spring Boot library
 - Multi-project support
 - Default dependency versions for Guava, Lombok, Jackson, JUnit 5, AssertJ
 - Optional `ruthless.lombok()`
 
For example see `ruthless-demo`. For details, see the source code.

## Usage

First, create `gradle.properties`:

```properties
group=com.example
version=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT

org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.configureondemand=true
```

Then, `settings.gradle.kts` to apply defaults. This will apply a base Ruthless plugin to all 
subprojects (multi-project is not enforced, you can go with single-project if you like that 
setup more):

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless")
}

rootProject.name = "my-project"
include(
        "my-project-app",
        "my-project-lib"
)
```

Then in `build.gradle.kts` for each project, you can specify the project type to apply basic
setup (not obligatory):

```
// For a Java library:
plugins {
    id("dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.java-library")
}

// For a Spring Boot application
plugins {
    id("dev.lajoscseppento.ruthless.spring-boot-application")
}
```

See `ruthless-demo` for a complete example. 

## Developing Ruthless

Ruthless is a standard Gradle plugin project.

For manual local testing, it is recommended to publish the plugin to the local Maven repository.

```sh
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Then use the local snapshot in the demo project:

```sh
cd ruthless-demo
../gradlew build -c settings-dev.gradle.kts
` ``
